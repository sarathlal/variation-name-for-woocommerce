Add names for each variation in WooCommerce variable products, replacing attribute dropdowns with descriptive variation names for easier selection.

== Description ==

Instead of the traditional dropdowns, you can display each variation as a named option, allowing users to quickly select the exact configuration they want. 

This plugin is ideal for variable products with multiple attributes, such as color, size, and material, helping users make decisions more efficiently and reducing abandonment due to complex dropdown navigation.

### Why Use Variation Name for WooCommerce?

For stores offering products with multiple attributes (e.g., color, size, material), traditional dropdowns / swatches can create a frustrating experience for users.
